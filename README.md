High-Accuracy Salary Prediction Web App ðŸ’µ
Welcome to the Salary Prediction project! This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from initial data analysis to deploying a highly accurate predictive model in a user-friendly web application.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand how to build not just a model, but a smart model, by using feature engineering to improve performance.

What Does This Project Do?
This application predicts an employee's potential salary based on several key factors:

Age

Years of Experience

Education Level

Job Title

Gender

The web app features a simple form where a user can select these details from dropdown menus. The prediction is then generated by a highly accurate Random Forest Regressor model.

Key Features & Techniques
High-Accuracy Model: The final model achieves an R-squared of 0.92, meaning it can explain 92% of the variation in salary.

Advanced Feature Engineering: To achieve this high accuracy, we created new, intelligent features:

Job_Level: A numerical feature to represent the seniority of a job title.

Experience_x_Level: An interaction feature to capture the idea that experience is more valuable at higher job levels.

User-Friendly Web App: Built with Streamlit for a clean and interactive user experience.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating our machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Streamlit: To create and run the interactive web application.

Jupyter Notebook: For the initial exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training experiments.

ðŸš€ How to Run This Project: A Step-by-Step Guide
Follow these steps to get the project running on your own computer.

Step 1: Get the Code & Setup
Download the Project: Download and extract the project zip file to a folder on your computer.

Add the Dataset: Place your salary_data_profession.csv file into the main project folder (salary-prediction-app/).

Open Your Terminal:

On Windows, search for Command Prompt or PowerShell.

On Mac or Linux, search for Terminal.

Navigate to the Project Folder: In your terminal, use the cd command to go into the project folder. For example:

cd Desktop/salary-prediction-app

Install Required Libraries: This project uses several Python libraries. The requirements.txt file lists all of them. Run this single command to install them all:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Train the Model
Before the web app can work, you need to run the Jupyter Notebook to train our final, high-accuracy model.

Start Jupyter Notebook: In your terminal (while inside the project folder), run this command:

jupyter notebook

This will open a new tab in your web browser.

Run the Notebook:

Click on the notebooks/ folder.

Click on salary_prediction_model.ipynb to open it.

In the menu at the top, click Run -> Run All Cells.

This will execute all the code, perform the feature engineering, train the final model, and automatically save the necessary files (salary_model.pkl and model_columns.pkl) into the saved_models folder.

Step 3: Launch the Web App!
Now for the final step.

Go back to your terminal. (You can open a new terminal window if Jupyter is still running).

Run the Streamlit command:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will open a new tab with your live application! You can now select different employee details and get highly accurate salary predictions.
